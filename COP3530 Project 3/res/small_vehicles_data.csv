Our family purchased this SUV less than a year ago at the Royal Automotive (Volvo, GMC and Volkswagen) Dealership, at the corner of Hwy. 31 and I-65 (Vestavia, AL)  2013 Infinity QX 56, 4WD Immaculate Condition - Inside and Out Loaded - Pure Luxury Price: $19,500 Current Miles: 119,895  Without hesitation of thought, this Infiniti QX56, is without doubt, the nicest vehicle our family has ever owned and/or driven, and we purchased this SUV, w the understanding of very limited local driving, but wanted access, to a nice SUV for our family, to take 2-3 vacation trips each year.  Prior to this purchase, this was a one-owner SUV, and since our (less-than-one-year) ownership, we’ve driven approximately 10k miles.   In all candor, and not to come across or sound overly confident in any way, this Seller strongly believes that, the first candidate that is, seriously shopping for a extremely clean, well maintained, high-quality, luxury SUV that, actually takes the time, to see & drive this SUV (will likely purchase it)...  This vehicle has so many features that perspective buyers, should consider referencing the VIN #, to query all of vehicle’s features.   This vehicle is aggressively priced, in relation to what the market reflects, as being priced significantly below (retail).  Owner is motivated, but not desperate, as other spouse is eager to just keep this SUV, and avoid rental SUVs, for future vacation trips.   Due to recent changes at work, owner is now driving, an extra 350-500 miles each month, so Seller is replacing this SUV, ideally w a more practical business Sedan.  Owner needs no assistance w selling this vehicle:  Serious interested parties and prospective Buyers, should shop other similar Infinity QX56 models, if only to see how competitively priced this SUV has been listed.  Prospective Buyer will be hard pressed to find as nice and pristine a 2013 Infinity QX56 as this vehicle is, for sale price.  It can sit beside a new 2020 QX 80 and be difficult to pick out the newest of the two vehicles.  This same vehicle would be listed between $21,500 - $23,500 or more, if sold on a retail car lot!",,al,33.3967,-86.8346,2021-04-16T16:49:05-0500

Sapphire’s Pro-1200 is fast becoming the industry’s leading slide-in truckmount. That’s because the Pro-1200 direct drive unit saves space while delivering robust heat and powerful extraction, especially when installed with the optional submount tank. The Pro-1200 can be used on hard surfaces, upholstery or carpet with plenty of heat and vacuum to clean quickly and thoroughly. Like all direct drive units, the Pro-1200 offers quicker warm-up time and simpler operation. The Pro-1200 has also been designed for the safety of van occupants, plus a separate drive belt that ensures that even if a belt fails, the van can still be driven. Based on the successful White Magic slide-in platform, Sapphire reengineered the Pro-1200 to include a number of improvements and innovations: Durable stainless steel heat-exchanger housings with unique finned copper core to capture more heat and last longer. A new wire harness to help prevent premature drive clutch failure and protect the vehicle electrical system. Improved heat exchangers, including a cross-flow design for the coolant heat exchanger and a silencer-equipped Vulcan blower exhaust exchanger reduces noise by up to 15db. Includes the Tuthill’s 5006 tri-lobe vacuum blower, which was specifically designed for Sapphire to reduce noise and increase heat output. The 1,200 PSI CAT water pump is fitted with high temperature seals to ensure long life. The driveshaft assembly is now mounted on rubber isolators to reduce vibration and noise. Easy-to-use instant total heat control located on the updated and operator-friendly front panel. Perhaps best of all, there is almost no scheduled maintenance required, aside from checking oil levels and belt condition. Because it is driven by your vehicle engine, there is no separate engine to maintain.  Get Sapphire’s signature high performance and dependable operation with reduced operating costs with the Pro-1200 direct drive unit. 870SS High Pressure Truckmount The versatile 870SS High Pressure truckmount delivers more heat, more vacuum, and more pressure for the biggest jobs. Producing up to 2,500 PSI heated solution, the 870SS Gardner Denver 410 tri-lobe blower delivers up to 16 inches Hg of vacuum, and up to 770 CFM of airflow. Add this to triple-source heat cogeneration and you have a truckmount that delivers the performance you need for high efficiency carpet cleaning with up to three operators and heated, high pressure hard surface cleaning using two tools. Power is provided by the water-cooled, four cylinder, 1.6-liter gasoline engine. Utilizing advanced emission and fuel consumption controls, this commercial-grade 63 HP engine is fully EPA-compliant. The use of these premium components ensures maximum reliability and durability. For the highest performance and durability, choose the 870SS Truckmount from Sapphire. All Sapphire truckmounts are protected under Sapphire’s exclusive two-year parts and labor warranty.

Here's a video I shot a couple days ago:  https://youtu.be/gpFt7jVmEmg   This is my weekend car. Bought it as a project a few years ago,  and made it road worthy. Having to sell it to fund maint on my daily driver.  It's got high miles (304k) but runs and sounds great.    Previous owner re-sealed the engine, and put a new clutch (Sachs) on the trans. Pulls very well on all gears.   Has a performance exhaust. It's loud when you step on it, but not annoying at hwy speeds. Sounds more like a rally car. Check video.    Do not contact me to sell me services!  Done by me in 2020 (I have receipts for most of the parts I bought from ebay, I can show you on my phone)  -Reman Bosch SR0448X starter (the original equipment) installed at around 290k miles -Shift lever boot (URO 25-11-1-221-700) installed in Feb-2021 -New NGK spark plugs (properly gapped) -New aftermarket fuel pump -New air intake hose, and associated smaller hoses -New headlights, and light bulbs -New interior lights (top lights, and installed all the  instrument lights, including light switch knob light and lighter) -New throttle position sensor -New PCV oil separator -New aftermarket idle control valve -New OEM Fuel Injection Idle Air Control Valve Hose  -New front turn signals -New engine crankshaft sensor -New BMW brand, driver's side handle assembly  Other repairs and maintenance done by me in 2020-21:  -Welded a leak on the gas tank -Changed the oil mid March 2021 with Castrol GTX synt oil -Removed and refreshed P/S oil with new ATF oil (end of March 2021) -Polished and nano-coated the paint (water repelling).  -Cleaned and detailed the top -Plastic welded a leak in the radiator.    Done by previous owner, circa 2017-2018:  -New radiator -All new cooling hoses -New heater valve -New water pump -New thermostat -New expansion tank -New alternator -New P/S pump -New belt, idlers, tensioner -New intake gaskets, all breather hoses -New Bilstien Sport Struts front and rear -New Bilstien springs front and rear -New strut mounts front and rear -All front bushings new -New front calipers -New Front brake pads, rotors, and sensors -Swapped 5-speed transmission -4.4"" final drive (very short gearing) -E39 wheels in great shape-Hub centric rings -New OE shifter -New master/slave cylinder -New clutch (OEM Sachs) -New pressure plate -New DUAL MASS flywheel... no conversion ($600 part!) -Rebuilt window regulators  Cons: -Cracked windshield -Door placards need to be refurbished (they aren't installed right now) -Convertible headliner sides are loose, but top is tight -Dent on rear trunk -Scratches in several places, however paint looks great -No AC -Front timing covers leaking.... 1 quart ever 2k miles or so. -Differential is leaking -Top has a few holes on the back (less than an inch in diameter). Car is kept in a garage and I don't drive it in rain, so no water entering in.  -Needs speakers, but the Alpine radio works.   Gorgeous 90s bimmer.  It's not a show car. Not fast, but the back end will slide out in a heartbeat, and has fun acceleration on the hwy.  You can install a differential w/ 3.8 final drive if you want, but I liked the torque the way it is and I think you will too.  Not a car for an inexperienced teenager!  Mostly interested in cash. But may consider a partial trade  for another car (project maybe) PLUS cash. No checks please, cash only.",,al,33.6493,-86.7057,2021-04-05T16:54:05-0500

It can be remote started using keyfob.  The  fob also will lock/unlock all doors.  It has a k9 alarm but the audible alarm isnt sounding off.    Runs great, idles great, and doesnt use oil.  The AC needs repair but the heater works perfectly. ABS light has been on but I haven't had any issues driving with it on.   I have had this Explorer since 1998 and have kept maintenance of it including oil changed regularly.  It has tinted windows but the drivers side is starting to bubble/crease.  Tint is easily removed by yourself if desired.  The passenger door opens only from the inside (driver has to reach over and open door for passenger.    It comes with an aftermarket Pioneer Supertuner CD/FM Stereo that also has AUX input.   There also are two 10 inch subwoofers with amp.  The odometer quit working at 218K miles.  I assume this Explorer has around 260K.  The carpet and seats are in great shape considering their age.    This Explorer allows 6 passengers.   The 80/20 front seat's  center console lifts up allowing a third person in the front and 3 in the back.   The 60/40 back seat allows different passenger vs storage solutions.  It was involved in a low speed accident where it turned into another car and damaged the driver-side fender, front-bumper, and headlamp assembly.  I replaced those items and the fender is a slightly different color shade of burgandy which is noticeable.  It has had no major engine issues except for the AC needs repair.  I have the clean title in hand.   I am located just north of Huntsville in Meridianville, conveniently near Memorial Parkway.  You can text or call two fifty-six, 5 twenty-7, thirty-8 fourty-8 and I also reply quickly to emails.  If you choose to call , please leave a message that you are calling about the Explorer and I will return your call asap.  There are lot of scammers here so you must be willing to meet in person.  I wont accept any money until after we meet with the vehicle.  I wont sell it unless you test drive it.",,al,34.8305,-86.5697,2021-04-12T21:10:35-0500

The truck had 27700 miles on it when i bought it (highway driver, no hauling) and i put the 5th Wheel hitch on it and bought the 2019 Winnebago NEW last summer from the same dealer at the same time. Everything about the 5th Wheel (from hitch to rear bumper) is in like-new shape (some stickers still on the appliances). I have only towed the trailer about 8000 - 9000 miles and it has virtually no wear/tear. I was stored from November until May. I pulled the trailer from Washington to Colorado to Texas and back to Washington three times for work, the rest of the mileage is long highway commutes. My job changed and i don't need it anymore.   Truck: 2019 F350 Super Duty Lariat Package (fully loaded) New Tires at ~40,000 miles, and they are in great shape, as i've towed very little and only drive on the freeway.  I had Ford add the F350 front end stabilizer upgrade, although the trailer pulls straight (belt & suspenders) Long list of options included, fully decked out I take care of my equipment and you'll find nothing but road dust on this beauty.   5th Wheel Hitch: Reese 20K Adjustable Track for tight manuvering  Trailer: 2019 Winnebago Minnie Plus 5th Wheel Model# 29RBH 2019C VIN# 54CFM4Y2XK4024684 Bought NEW 6/27/2020 (same time as i bought the truck) Exterior: Platinum Interior: Pearl Theater Seating Extreme Weather Package RVIA Tag Wide Screen TV Electric Fireplace/Heater Bunk House Two Slide Outs Two Doors Bathroom for Privacy Queen Bed Three Bunks and Storage in Bunk House Lots of Storage Everywhere Leveling Blocks Electric rear stabilizers Back Up Camera Out Door Shower Out Door Fridge and Stove Top LPG Connection for BBQ LPG & Electric Heat Two Air Conditioners LED lighting Full Electric Awning (never used) I proactively replaced the tires at 5000 miles. They are top quality E rated tires. All Cords/plugs/etc are of the highest quality (over $2000 of stuff)  See video here (not my trailer, just off of YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7jkoE0_JZI  Full Details on the Trailer Model: https://www.rvusa.com/rv-guide/2019-winnebago-minnie-plus-fifth-wheel-floorplan-29rbh-tr39785   Please inquire only if you have decided that is set up is what you want. I am crazy busy and really just want to work with someone if they love the rig.   I don't need the trailer and the truck is a BEAST of a machine. Best 1-Ton Puller on the road, as can be attested to by all the guys at the fuel stops who i talked to. The F350 Super Duty tows the trailer like magic and i was never under powered or under-braked.   Generator: https://www.cummins.com/generators/onan-p4500i-inverter-portable-generator  I have a hella good Cummings generator that i will negotiate on but they are sold out and very hard to find, for good reason. Bought it at Power Generation Service in Albuquerque, still under warranty. It is NOT for sale with the rig, but would consider adding it into the package if its really important to the buyer.   The rig is currently in Bellingham WA. I will deliver to Anchorage on the Ferry or you can pick up.

Replaced (wimpy) factory power steering pump with a (beefy) Saginaw conversion. Replaced coolant lines. Replaced plugs, distributor rotor, battery and coil. Installed new shocks throughout. Installed stereo and speakers. Replaced wiper arms and blades. Installed rubber floor mats front and rear. Installed new dash cap. The previous owner (we keep in touch) replaced the transmission and radiator a year or two before my purchase. This is an Arizona cruiser, so it’s practically rust free.

I purchased this car from the second owner in October 2019 with 54,xxx on the odometer.  During my ownership, this car has treated me very well, and undergone several cross-country road trips.  I am only selling the vehicle because I purchased another wagon, and have no use for two.  Autocheck and Carfax reports, as well as a maintenance spreadsheet are available on request.   The car has a lot of options, including a panoramic glass roof, climate control, cruise control, heated steering wheel, sport seats, autodim mirrors, power windows and locks, xenon lights, among others. Tires are in decent shape, and the car is in excellent mechanical shape.  All maintenance and repairs are up to date, and I have receipts for all work done under my ownership.  Interior and exterior condition are good to excellent.  I’m happy to snap any additional pics.  Thanks for looking!

Runs and drives. 5-speed manual transmission. Clear AZ title. Only costs $25 to fill the tank from dead empty with the light on and gets 30 mpg city/38 mpg highway. Even still a half tank of gas in it for you. Only selling because I'm 7 months pregnant and need something a little bigger for the baby.  The rear quarter panel and a small part of the hatch door have unfinished body repairs. The body work on the rear quarter panel has already been finished and is ready for paint and the hatch door is already Bondo'd and only needs sanded and repainted (willing to finish it for you if you just cover the cost of the paint). The rest of the exterior is in like new condition with no dings or scratches at all and exterior of the soft top is in like new condition too. The interior is in great condition and everything works. Power windows, power locks, soft top convertible works, just had the interior mini-detailed yesterday (seats and carpet shampooed and all surfaces disinfected so its 100% COVID-friendly). 👌  Mechanically sound and very reliable. Motor runs strong. Theres a problem with the clutch not shifting into 3rd gear, but I just found out this morning that it's listed as a recall and can be replaced at the Fiat dealership free of charge. I just had 2 new tires put on within the last 2 weeks too.. If you're wanting the body work finished, Id be happy to take it in to the dealer to have it fixed for you. I already paid to have the windows tinted also, so if you want them done I have the voucher or I can get it done for you if you want the body work finished too.. Emissions good thru April 2022. I'm willing to deliver car to you if needed also. If you have any questions call or text 4eight0 - 4five3 - seven3six1 or 6zero2 - 3three0 - 9zero2eight. KBB values it between $9500-10,200. Asking price depends on whether you want the body work finished, tint installed and clutch recall handled for you. If you do, I'm willing to accept a partial payment until its all done (4 days at most).   **Please do not contact me with solicitationsor offers to help me sell my vehicle. ** Thank you!",,az,33.402465,-111.935263,2021-05-04T11:26:42-0700

Beautiful black exterior with black nappa leather interior and there are NO marks or tears anywhere. I bought it from the second owner in southern California.  It has a 5.5 liter V-8 with around 400 hp and a 7-speed transmission with paddle shifters on the steering wheel. Car is loaded with all factory options including auto-closing doors and keyless entry, it has night vision, push button start, distronic cruise control, active dynamic seats, heated and cooled massaging seats in the front, and rear reclining seats which are also heated and cooled! Rear window shade, high-end Harmon Kardon sound system, back-up camera, auto closing trunk and many other options. All windows have the high-end tint and UV protection. Yes, it's fully loaded and everything works.  The car now has 171,400 miles (only 12,200 miles a year) but you would never guess it. I really looks and drives like half the mileage. The engine is strong and quiet and the whole suspension was worked on a few years ago with replacement struts and pump. There are substantial receipts for maintenance work that has been done on the car. Comprehensive full maintenance since new by only Mercedes Benz dealers. The transmission shifts smoothly with no issues. There is nothing wrong with this car and EVERYTHING works! You couldn't find a nicer Mercedes S550 for the money.   I'm asking $9,4500 or best offer. Please don't waste my time with low offers as the car is well worth the price. Cash only, no trades are wanted. I am in no hurry as I am looking for the right S63.

This stunning, rust free, all original Q45 from dry Colorado has a clean Auto Check history. It is in EXCEPTIONAL condition and issue-free. Turn the key and go.   The Q45 is admired by both consumer report services and individual owners as a world class touring sedan. It is revered for its impeccable yet simple design, luxury features, and powerful, quiet, smooth performance.  The second generation Q45 from 1998 has a distinctive look with a long sloping nose, thin roof line, and steeply raked rear glass. Strong character lines separate the upper and lower flanks.   BODY/PAINT The car retains its original pearl white paint, still very glossy with only a few barely noticeable scuffs. It has obviously been well cared for over its 22-year life, collectors will appreciate. Car panels are straight with no dings, dents, and just a few minor scuffs. Chrome and stainless trim pieces are near perfect. Headlamp and signal lamp lenses are perfectly clear, zero clouding. Glass is all original and excellent condition, even the original Nissan windshield.  INTERIOR Extremely clean, non-smoker, no odors. Leather seats are soft and supple with almost no wear. Dash appears factory fresh, no cracks or blemishes. Center console and two-tone door panels and armrests are pristine, including all the wood grain pieces. Carpeting is in great condition with no stains or wear-through, as are the original floor mats front and rear.  Headliner and sun visors are very nice with working vanity lights.  Dash controls and power window and power seat features are fully operational and blemish-free. Has a power sunroof and power tilt/telescoping steering wheel. The automatic climate control, premium eight-speaker Bose sound system, cruise control, courtesy lights, and other interior electronic features are fully functional.  Heated power front seats adjust in ten directions and have power lumbar supports. There is a two-position memory for driver entry and exit. Car is outfitted with Home Link, a programmable transmitter system for opening gates and garage doors.  WHEELS/TIRES Tires are newer Michelin sport/touring radials, P215/60R/16 with approximately 75% tread life remaining. They wrap the factory chrome 16 inch alloy wheels in near perfect condition, no road rash.  MECHANICAL The motor is smooth and powerful, shifts effortlessly and quietly. The car is an absolute pleasure to drive. It rockets forward while remaining dead quiet at high speed, almost like an electric bullet train. I’ve had the car over 100 mph with AC on full in 110 degree Phoenix heat, with no overheating or other issues.  PERFORMANCE SPECS    Fuel injected 4.1 liter 32 valve V8    270 hp, 280 torque    4-spd automatic overdrive transmission    Zero to 60 in 7.4 seconds    15.4 second quarter mile drag time    Factory top speed 144 mph    Decent gas mileage 18/23  Engine has variable valve timing, which adjusts valve opening and closing according to engine speed and load. Variable valve timing is a key element in the engine's efficiency. It's a proven technology and a big plus.  ROAD HANDLING Engine and transmission are connected electronically with smooth precise shifts based on speed and load. There is a seamless flow of power with no hesitation or jerkiness between shifts. The Q45 performs like a great touring sedan should with:     Variable assist power steering    Macpherson front strut suspension with coil spring assist    Front and rear stabilization    Electronic full range traction control    Four wheel anti-lock disc brakes    Limited slip differential  The rear suspension has a multi-link arrangement designed to keep more tire contact patch on the road, and more patch means more grip. Anti-dive and anti-squat characteristics mean improved grip under hard braking and acceleration.  HIGHLIGHTS Photos of the engine bay, suspension and undercarriage reveal this car’s strikingly clean mechanics with no corrosion or damage anywhere and factory chalk marks visible.  Floor pans underneath still show some glossy factory paint.  Auto Check confirms the car’s regular maintenance history. Reading multiple reviews from private owners, I discover that it’s nothing to put well over 200,000 miles on these cars with no issues if normal maintenance is accomplished.  Car comes with two sets of original keys, FOB remotes, leather bound owner’s manual set, original jack and unused spare.  The fully optioned MSRP for the Q45 was $48,890 in 1998, equating to $84,000 in today's dollars. Only 10,443 were built in 1998, making them increasingly rare as time goes on. They have reached the bottom of their depreciation curve and are becoming collectible. Now’s the time.

It's made by Honda and is basically a fancy Pilot, so it has 3-row seating (7 total passengers). Ours has just 127k miles and is in EXCELLENT mechanical condition. It runs and drives GREAT! We wouldn't hesitate to drive it across the country tomorrow! We're only selling it because we bought a newer MDX.  Our MDX has the optional Technology package, which includes in-dash navigation system with voice recognition, a surround-sound premium audio system, a back-up camera, and solar-sensing climate control. Standard features include 300hp V6 engine, all-wheel drive (SH-AWD), 5-speed shiftable automatic transmission, heated leather seats, dual power seats, xenon HID headlights, power moonroof, tri-zone climate control, XM radio, 6-disc CD/MP3 changer, etc. Installed options/upgrades include towing package (5,000lbs), roof rack, WeatherTech floor mats, and custom 20-inch wheels/tires.  Recent services include: 97k miles = timing belt 114k miles = power steering pump rebuilt 121k miles = front brakes (rotors, pads) 124k miles = new battery; rear brakes (rotors, pads); new 20-inch tires 126k miles = oil change; wheel alignment 127k miles = new coolant; new oil pressure sending unit; new Iridium spark plugs  What's NOT to like about our MDX? The paint is oxidizing on the roof. The moonroof doesn't close easily. Bluetooth doesn't work. Minor scratches/dings on the exterior. We've already considered these items in our $9,800 price, so if they're an issue for you, please look elsewhere.  We might consider trading our Acura for a reliable 4-door truck. We WILL add cash for the right deal. Must be 2003 or newer, reasonable miles, non-smoking interior, with a clean title. Preferably 4x4.

It came with a recently rebuilt engine and all new brake components. I discovered that the gas tank was rusting through, so I replaced it and drove to Mexico with no problems. The paint was hideous, so I had it repainted in Mexico. Since then, it’s been driven back and forth between Tucson/Phoenix and Mexico. I only drive it for a few weeks in the winter. It’s spent summers in a friend’s back yard with a sun cover over it. I’ve made several improvements, but it’s really not the right car to be a daily driver in Mexico. It needs to go to a better home where it can receive more love!  The Good:  It turns heads and draws comments everywhere I go! Rebuilt engine runs strong: 80mph and 30mpg. No collision damage. Seatpans are solid, no rust. Kenwood stereo. New battery 3/21 New headliner and driver’s seat cover. New rubber around the windows and more rubber waiting to be installed. SCAT short-throw shifter. Pertronix SVDA distributor. Aftermarket exhaust and air cleaner. Oil changed and valves adjusted every 1500 miles while I’ve owned it. Lots of spare “get me home” parts: spare 009 distributor with new points and condenser, spare carb, fuel pump, throttle and clutch cables, fan belt. Suncover and driver’s sheepskin. It’s really fun to drive!  The Bad:  New paint is cracking around the headlights and a few other places. New seatback cover began tearing immediately at the bottom when the seatback is moved forward. There are two small rust holes in the engine compartment floor and one next to the gas filler cap. None are visible from outside. Some rust inside below the passenger quarter window. Both bumpers need to be re-chromed or replaced. I have new brackets. Driver’s door glass needs alignment and new inner scrapers. I have scrapers and clips. The horn works but there’s no horn button or wiring. I put new seals on the leaking oil cooler in February, but the engine still needs solvent cleaning. It’s 52 years old!  The car is located at Chirco Performance in Tucson, AZ.  $7500 obo.",,az,32.206076,-110.798145,2021-04-23T10:30:44-0700

I registered and titled it in my name 05/03/21. According to the DMV I can't sign the title over until I receive it in the mail but can still give you a bill of sale until I can receive it and sign it over. So... there's that.  Basic Transportation. Great work rig, 2nd rig or First Time Driver vehicle. The Good: Runs Well. Drives Well. Stops Okay. Body is in pretty good shape for the age. Interior and upholstery are also in pretty good shape. It wants to run and will get to 60 pretty quickly for a 17 year old SUV. Original owner tells me she's solid at 80. She seats 5 with an astonishing amount of rear leg room and ample cargo room left over. All power windows and locks work. The original owner tells me all servicing from purchased new in 2004 has been done at Crain Hyundai. It's got tags good through May 2022. The Bad: It's going to need brakes but is very driveable as is. It can probably use an oil change. It's at 295,000 miles. Upholstery can use a good cleaning. The windshield has a horizontal crack in it but it is well below the driver's eye line. The spare tire is on the car. 1 original rim is in the cargo area as the tire that went flat was not salvageable. The air conditioning does not work as apparently it needs a compressor. That is everything I know about the car. CASH ONLY. NO CASHIERS CHECKS/CHECKS. WILL NOT SHIP OR DELIVER.",,ar,36.062549,-94.164047,2021-05-03T12:59:23-0500

For sale is my Silver 2011 Toyota Sienna LE AWD. It is my daily driver and hauls the entire family. It has 117K miles currently. Everything works as it should. Hot heat. Cold A/C. Bluetooth audio. No warning lights on dash. Engine/transmission runs smooth and climbs hills easily with the AWD drivetrain. I've taken it on a road trip to NYC in December with no issues. Wouldn't hesitate to drive it anywhere.  Since I've owned it I've done the following: * Replaced all four brake pads and rotors (Nov/2020). * Oil changed every 5K miles(last change in March) * Cabin Air filter changed * Added LED low/High beam headlights * Added premium car seat covers on all rows * Added brand new tires one month ago  The car does have a rebuilt title due to it being hit on the rear passenger side door. (No airbags were deployed). It was repaired and painted.(The last picture shows the minor damage before the repair). The front bumper was also replaced at the same time due to having many scratches and scuffs. The vehicle does have some other small scuffs and minor dents around the body but they are minor.  The only thing the car will need sometime in the future is having the front struts replaced. They are making some squeaking noise. I am willing to negotiate the price with that in consideration to serious buyers.  I am asking $9400/obo CASH ONLY. Motivated to sell. If you are serious, throw me an offer. I have the title in hand under my name. I am the owner of the minivan and not a dealer. I am selling this minivan to purchase a brand new AWD Sienna because I fell in love with Sienna after purchasing this van.  Located in Fayetteville, AR close to the University of Arkansas.
